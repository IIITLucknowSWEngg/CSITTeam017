### 4.1 Database Schema
The database will be structured to store and retrieve data related to users, meetings, participants, and notifications. The major collections or tables will include:

- **Users**: Stores user profile data, including name, email, password, preferences, and authentication tokens.
- **Meetings**: Stores meeting details, such as title, scheduled time, participants, and status.
- **Participants**: A mapping of which users are participating in which meetings.
- **Notifications**: Stores meeting-related notifications like reminders and updates.
- **Meeting Recordings**: Metadata about recordings, such as file location, meeting ID, and participant list.

### 4.2 Data Flow
- Users will create and schedule meetings, which will be stored in the **Meetings** collection.
- When a user joins a meeting, the participant is recorded in the **Participants** table.
- Notifications are stored in the **Notifications** collection, which is sent via email/SMS or real-time channels.
- Meeting recordings and associated data will be stored in a cloud storage solution like **Amazon S3**.

### 5.1 API Design
The system will expose REST APIs and GraphQL endpoints for the frontend and third-party integrations:

- **POST /users/register**: Registers a new user.
- **POST /users/login**: Authenticates a user and returns a token.
- **POST /meetings**: Creates a new meeting.
- **GET /meetings/{id}**: Retrieves meeting details.
- **POST /join**: Allows a user to join an existing meeting using a meeting ID/link.
- **GET /notifications**: Fetches unread notifications.

### 5.2 Real-Time Communication
The backend will use **WebSocket** or **WebRTC signaling** to facilitate real-time communication for audio/video and chat functionalities. Additionally, the backend will support sending real-time notifications to the frontend when there are updates to meetings or user activities.

### 5.3 Third-Party Integration
- **Google Calendar API**: Sync meetings and send calendar invites.
- **WebRTC**: Real-time communication protocol for video/audio streaming and screen sharing.

- Video and audio streams should have **low latency**, providing a seamless experience.

### 6.2 Scalability
- The system must be horizontally scalable, able to handle a growing number of users and meetings.
- Load balancing should be implemented to manage user traffic efficiently across multiple servers.

### 6.3 Availability
- The system must ensure **99.9% uptime** with backup servers and automatic failover mechanisms.

### 6.4 Security
- The system must implement **end-to-end encryption** for video/audio streams and chat messages.

- Data should be encrypted both at rest and in transit.

### 6.5 Usability
- The platform should offer a **responsive design** for both desktop and mobile devices.
- The UI must be **intuitive** and user-friendly, providing clear instructions for joining and scheduling meetings.

## 7. Conclusion
This Software Design Description (SDD) outlines the architecture, components, database design, and interfaces for the Google Meet-like video conferencing system. The design ensures scalability, security, and real-time communication, while providing a smooth and responsive user experience. The modular architecture allows easy maintenance and future enhancements, such as adding new features like recording, live captions, or enhanced collaboration tools.
