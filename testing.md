# Testing Meeting Application Project

Testing is a crucial phase in the development of a Meeting Application Project to ensure that it meets its intended requirements, functions correctly, and is free of bugs. Below are some key steps and considerations for the testing phase of a Meeting Application.

---

## 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual features such as **video streaming**, **audio management**, **screen sharing**, and **chat functionalities**.
- Validate APIs for **user authentication**, **meeting scheduling**, and **media handling**.  
**Example:** Ensure the mute/unmute button updates the audio state correctly without affecting other participants.

---

## 2. Integration Testing
- Validate the interaction between modules like **backend servers**, **database operations**, and **client interfaces**.
- Test interactions between **real-time communication protocols** (e.g., WebRTC) and the application’s UI.  
**Example:** Ensure the hand-raising feature integrates seamlessly with the participant list updates.

---

## 3. Functional Testing
- Verify core functionalities, including:
  - **Joining/Leaving Meetings**
  - **Screen Sharing**
  - **Recording Sessions**
  - **Breakout Rooms**  
**Example:** Test that a user joining late can see ongoing shared screens and chat history.

---

## 4. User Interface (UI) Testing
- Test for an **intuitive UI** with clearly labeled buttons (e.g., mic, camera, share screen).
- Ensure **dark mode compatibility** and **responsive design** for mobile devices.  
**Example:** Check that the "End Call" button is consistently positioned and visually distinct.

---

## 5. Performance Testing
- Simulate varying numbers of participants (10, 100, 500+) to assess **latency**, **video quality**, and **connection stability**.
- Measure the system’s response time under poor network conditions.  
**Example:** Test how the app behaves when several participants turn on video simultaneously during a meeting.

---

## 6. Security Testing
- Test for vulnerabilities such as **eavesdropping** and **unauthorized meeting access**.
- Validate **end-to-end encryption** and secure handling of personal data.  
**Example:** Attempt unauthorized access to a password-protected meeting and verify system resistance.

---

## 7. Usability Testing
- Gather feedback from users with varying technical expertise.
- Focus on features like **joining via invite links** and **interpreting meeting controls**.  
**Example:** Verify that a non-technical user can easily locate and use the “Raise Hand” feature.

---

## 8. Compatibility Testing
- Test the application across:
  - **Browsers:** Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox.
  - **Devices:** Smartphones, tablets, desktops.
  - **Operating Systems:** Windows, macOS, Android, iOS.  
**Example:** Ensure smooth video playback on older Android devices.

---

## 9. Regression Testing
- Revalidate previous test cases after every new update, particularly after adding features like **transcription** or integration with third-party tools.  
**Example:** Confirm that chat functionality remains intact after adding a feature for auto-translating messages.

---

## 10. Deployment Testing
- Test in **production-like environments** to ensure real-world functionality.
- Conduct live tests with a limited audience to check deployment stability.  
**Example:** Launch the application to a select group of beta users to gather feedback on performance and reliability.

This structured testing approach ensures the application meets technical requirements while delivering a seamless, secure, and reliable user experience.
